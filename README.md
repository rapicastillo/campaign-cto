If you'd like to add onto this body of knowledge, here's a guide!

1. Go to your state's folder (`NY`, `CA`, etc). If you can't find it, add a folder!
2. Go to the type of race you ran (`Congress`, `Senate`, `Gubernatorial`, `State Assembly`, etc)
3. Add your file! You can name it however you want (we'll moderate it), but best to name it like so: `<candidate_name>_<election_year>.MD` eg `mickey_mouse_2019.md`
4. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` and add fill it out!
